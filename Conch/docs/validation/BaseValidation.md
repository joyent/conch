## Description

`Conch::Validation` provides the base class to define and execute Conch
Validations. Validations extend this class by implementing a `validate`
method.  This method receives the input data (a `HASHREF`) to be validatated.
This input data hash may be validated by setting the `schema` attribute with a
schema definition in the [JSON-schema](http://json-schema.org) format (Note: A
root-level `'object'` type is assumed in the schema. Only top-level
properties need to be defined).

The validation logic in the `validate` method will evaluate the input data and
register one or more validation results with the
[register\_result](#register_result) method. The logic may use device, device
settings, hardware product name, hardware product vendor, and hardware product
profile details to dispatch conditions and evaluation.

Conch Validations should also define values for the `name`, `version`,
`category`, and `description` attributes. These attributes are used in the
identification of the validation and validation result storage in the
Validation System infrastructure.

Testing Conch Validations should be done with
`Test::Conch::Validation::test_validation` with TAP-based tests. This
functions tests that Validations define the required attributes and methods,
and allow you to test the validation logic by running test cases against
expected results.

## Methods

### Validation\_Results

Get the list of all validation results.

### New

Construct a Validation object.

All attributes are optional, but executing validation with [run](https://metacpan.org/pod/run) will create
an error validation result if . For example, if [hardware\_product\_profile](https://metacpan.org/pod/hardware_product_profile) is
used in the definition of [validate](https://metacpan.org/pod/validate) but the `hardware_product` attribute is
unspecified during construction with [new](https://metacpan.org/pod/new), the validation will halt and an
error validation result will be created.

- `device`

    [Conch::Model::Device](https://metacpan.org/pod/Conch::Model::Device) object under validation.

- `device_location`

    [Conch::Class::DeviceLocation](https://metacpan.org/pod/Conch::Class::DeviceLocation) object for the device being validated.

- `hardware_product`

    The expected [Conch::Class::HardwareProduct](https://metacpan.org/pod/Conch::Class::HardwareProduct) object for the device being validated.

- `device_settings`

    A key-value `HASHREF` of device settings stored for the device being
    validated. Empty `HAHSREF` if unspecified.

- `result_builder`

    An optional `CODEREF` to construct validation results. If unspecified,
    validation results are built as `HASHREF`s. The `CODEREF` will be passed a
    list of attributes and values (Attributes are 'message', 'name', 'category',
    'status', and 'hint') whenever a validation result is created.

### Run

Run the Validation with the specified input data.

```
    $validation->run($validation_data);
```

### Run\_Unsafe

Run the Validation with the specified input data. Re-throws any exception raised
during execution as [Mojo::Exception](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo::Exception)

```
    eval {
            $validation->run_unsafe($validation_data)
    };
    say $@->frames if $@;
```

### Check\_Against\_Schema

Check the Validation input data against the JSON schema, if specified.

### Validate

Contains the validation logic for validations.

This method must be re-defined in sub-classes of `Conch::Validation` or it will
raise an exception.

```perl
    package MyValidation;
    use Mojo::Base 'Conch::Validation';

    sub validate {
            my ($self, $data) = @_;
            $self->register_result({ expected => 1, got => $data->{pass} });
    }
```

### Device

Get the `Conch::Model::Device` object under Validation. Use in validation
logic to dispatch on Device attributes.

```perl
    my $device = $self->device;
    if ($device->trition_setup) {...}
```

### Device\_Settings

Get device settings assidned to the device under validation. Device settings
are an unblessed hashref. You can use device setting values to provide
conditional evaluation in the validation logic.

```perl
    my $threshold = $self->device_settings->{some_threshold};
    return if $self->device_settings->{skip_this_validation};
```

### Has\_Device\_Location

Return a boolean whether the device under validation has been assigned a
location.

### Device\_Location

Get the `Conch::Class::DeviceLocation` object for the device under validation.
This is useful in writing validation logic that may depend on the rack or
location in the rack a device occupies. Throws an error if the device hasn't
been assigned a location.

```perl
    my $datacenter_name = $self->device_location->datacenter->name;
    my $rack_unit = $self->device_location->rack->unit;
    my $rack_slots = $self->device_location->rack->slots;
```

### Hardware\_Product\_Name

Get the expected hardware product name for the device under validation.

```perl
    if ($self->hardware_product_name eq 'Joyent-123') {...}
```

### Hardware\_Product\_Vendor

Get the expected hardware product vendor name for the device under validation.

```perl
    if ($self->hardware_product_vendor eq 'Dell') {...}
```

### Hardware\_Product\_Profile

Get the expected hardware product profile for the device under validation. In
production, the product profile is a `Conch::Class:HardareProductProfile` object.

```perl
    my $expected_ram = self->hardware_product_profile->ram_total;
    my $expected_ssd = self->hardware_product_profile->ssd_num;
    my $expected_firmware = self->hardware_product_profile->bios_firmware;
```

### Register\_Result

Register a Validation Result in the validation logic. `register_result` may be
called as many times as desired in a `validate` method.

Instead of calculating whether a result should pass or fail in the validation
logic, provide an 'expected' value, the 'got' value, and a comparison operator.
This declarative syntax allows for result de-duplication and consistent messages.

```perl
    # direct comparison
    $self->register_result( expected => 'hello', got => 'hello' );
    $self->register_result( expected => 42, got => 42 );

    # specified comparison operator
    $self->register_result( expected => 1, got => 2, cmp => '>=' );
    $self->register_result( expected => 'second', got => 'first', cmp => 'lt' );

    # using 'like' to match with a regex
    $self->register_result( expected => qr/.+bar.+/, got => 'foobarbaz', cmp => 'like' );

    # using 'oneOf' to select one of multiple values
    $self->register_result( expected => ['a', 'b', 'c' ], got => 'b', cmp => 'oneOf' );
```

The default operator is 'eq'. The available comparison operators are:

```
    '==', '!=', '>', '>=', '<', '<=', '<=',
    'eq', 'ne', 'lt', 'le', 'gt', 'ge',
    'like' (regex comparison), 'oneOf' (list membership comparison)
```

You may also provide the following attributes to override validation results

- `name`

    By default, the validation result stores the `name` attribute of the
    Validation class. You may override the validation result name with this
    attribute.

    ```perl
        $self->register_result(
                expected => 'hello',
                got      => 'hello',
                name     => 'hello_validation'
        );
    ```

- `message`

    The default message stored in the validation result has the form, "Expected
    $operator '$expected\_value'. Got '$got\_value'.". You may override this message
    by specifying the `message` attribute.

    ```perl
        $self->register_result(
                expected => 'hello',
                got      => 'hello',
                message  => 'Hello world!'
        );
    ```

- `category`

    By default, the validation result stores the `category` attribute of the
    Validation class. You may override the validation result category with this
    attribute.

    ```perl
        $self->register_result(
                expected => 'hello',
                got      => 'hello',
                category => 'BIOS'
        );
    ```

- `component_id`

    You may specify the optional string attribute `component_id` to set an
    identifier to help identify a specific component under test.

    ```perl
        $self->register_result(
                expected     => 'OK',
                got          => $disk->{health},
                component_id => $disk->{serial_number}
        );
    ```

- `hint`

    You may specify the optional string attribute `hint` to be stored **if**
    the validation fails. This string should help identify to a user how to fix the
    validation failure. If the validation succeeds, the hint string is not stored
    in the validation result.

    ```perl
        $self->register_result(
                expected  => 'hello',
                got       => 'bye',
                hint      => "Try saying 'hello' instead"
        );
    ```

### Die

Stop execution of the Validation immediately and record an error.

```perl
    $self->die('This validation cannot continue!') if $bad_condition;
```

### Fail

Record a failing validation result with a message and continues execution. This
may be useful if you cannot validate some part of the input data but want to
continue validating other parts of the data.

```perl
    $self->fail('This validation fails but validation evaluation will continue')
            unless defined( $data->{required_value} );
```

The attributes `name`, `category`, `component_id`, and `hint` may be
specified like with `register_result`.

```perl
    $self->fail('I fail!',
            name => 'some_component_validation',
            hint => 'How to fix this failure...'
    );
```

### Failures

Get the list of validation results that were failures

### Successes

Get the list of validation results that were successful

### Error

Get the list of validation results that have error status (halted execution).

_NOTE:_ Unless `run` is called multiple times on the same validation object
without calling `clear_results` between, there should be at most 1 error
validation because execution is halted.

### Clear\_Results

Clear the stored validation results.
