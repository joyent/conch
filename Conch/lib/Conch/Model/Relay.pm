=head1 METHODS

=cut

package Conch::Model::Relay;
use Mojo::Base -base, -signatures;

use Conch::Class::Relay;
use Conch::Time;

use Conch::Pg;

=head2 register

Create a new relay record if the relay serial (ID) is unique. Otherwise, update
an existing relay's version, IP address, SSH port, alias, and updated timestamp

=cut

sub register ( $self, $serial, $version, $ipaddr, $ssh_port, $alias ) {
	Conch::Pg->new->db->query(
		q{
		INSERT INTO relay
			( id, version, ipaddr, ssh_port, alias, updated )
		VALUES
			( ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? )
		ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE
		SET
			id       = excluded.id,
			version  = excluded.version,
			ipaddr   = excluded.ipaddr,
			ssh_port = excluded.ssh_port,
			alias    = excluded.alias,
			updated  = excluded.updated
		},
		$serial,
		$version,
		$ipaddr,
		$ssh_port,
		$alias,
		'NOW()'
	)->rows;
}

=head2 lookup

Look up a relay by ID.

=cut

sub lookup ( $self, $relay_id ) {
	my $maybe_relay =
		Conch::Pg->new->db->select( 'relay', undef, { id => $relay_id } )->hash;
	return $maybe_relay && Conch::Class::Relay->new($maybe_relay);
}

=head2 connect_user_relay

Associate relay with a user.

=cut

sub connect_user_relay ( $self, $user_id, $relay_id ) {

	# 'first_seen' column will only be written on create. It should remain
	# unchanged on updates
	return Conch::Pg->new->db->query(
		q{
		INSERT INTO user_relay_connection
			( user_id, relay_id, last_seen )
		SELECT ?, relay.id, NOW()
		FROM relay
		WHERE relay.id = ?
		ON CONFLICT (user_id, relay_id) DO UPDATE
		SET
			user_id   = excluded.user_id,
			relay_id  = excluded.relay_id,
			last_seen = excluded.last_seen
		}, $user_id, $relay_id
	)->rows;
}

=head2 connect_device_relay

Associate relay with a device

=cut

sub connect_device_relay ( $self, $device_id, $relay_id ) {

	# 'first_seen' column will only be written on create. It should remain
	# unchanged on updates
	return Conch::Pg->new->db->query(
		q{
		INSERT INTO device_relay_connection
			( device_id, relay_id, last_seen )
		SELECT ?, relay.id, NOW()
		FROM relay
		WHERE relay.id = ?
		ON CONFLICT (device_id, relay_id) DO UPDATE
		SET
			device_id = excluded.device_id,
			relay_id  = excluded.relay_id,
			last_seen = excluded.last_seen
		}, $device_id, $relay_id
	)->rows;
}

=head2 list

Provide a list of all relays in the database as Class::Relay objects

=cut

sub list ( $self ) {
	my @relays;
	for my $r ( Conch::Pg->new->db->select('relay')->hashes->@* ) {
		$r->{created} = Conch::Time->new( $r->{created} ) if $r->{created};
		$r->{updated} = Conch::Time->new( $r->{updated} ) if $r->{updated};
		push @relays, Conch::Class::Relay->new($r);
	}
	return @relays;
