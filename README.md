# Conch API Server

Conch helps you build and manage datacenters.

Conch's goal is to provide an end-to-end solution for full datacenter resource
lifecycle: from design to initial power-on to end-of-life for all components of
all devices.

Conch is open source, licensed under MPL2.

## Caveat Emptor

At the time of writing, the API is not considered to be stable. While we do our
best to prevent breakage, the core is in considerable flux and we do not
guarantee fit or function right now. The [conch
shell](https://github.com/joyent/conch-shell) is our current stable interface.

## Installation

### Operating System Support

We currently support SmartOS 17.4 and Docker/Ubuntu. Being a Perl app, the API
should run most anywhere but the code is only actively tested on SmartOS and
Docker/Ubuntu.

### Perl Support

The API is only certified to run against Perl 5.26.

### Setup

Below is a list of useful Make commands that can be used to build and run the
project. All of these should be run in the top level directory.

* `make run` -- Build the project and run it
* `make test` -- Run tests
* `make migrate-db` -- Run database migrations

#### Needed Packages

* PostgreSQL 9.6.x
* Git
* Perl, 5.26 or above (e.g. via [perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/))
* [Carton](https://metacpan.org/dist/Carton)

#### Configuration

Copy `conch.conf.dist` to `conch.conf`, modifying for any local parameters,
including database connectivity information.

### Starting Conch

* `make run`

## Docker

### Compose

The most simple way to get going with the Conch API is to use Docker Compose.

#### Build

First, build the image locally using `docker/builder.sh`

#### First Run

Copy `conch.conf.dist` to `conch.conf`, modifying for any local parameters.
Specifically search for 'docker' in the comments. Ignore the database
parameters.


```
# Edit compose file for desired release
docker-compose up -d postgres # initialize the postgres database
docker-compose run --rm web bin/conch-db all --username conch --email conch@example.com --password kaewee3hipheem8BaiHoo6waed7pha
docker-compose run --rm web bin/conch-db create-global-workspace
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Upgrading

```
docker-compose down
# Edit compose file for desired release
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d postgres
docker-compose run --rm web bin/conch-db migrate
docker-compose up -d
```

There may be extra commands to run, depending on the specific release. In that
case, the upgrade will look something like:

```
docker-compose down
# Edit compose file for desired release
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d postgres
docker-compose run --rm web bin/conch-db migrate
docker-compose run --rm web bin/conch upgrade_release_225
docker-compose up -d
```
