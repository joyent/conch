# Conch

Database build and management service

# Setup

Conch uses `carton` to manage dependencies. Install `carton` and run `carton
install` or `make deps` in the `Conch/` directory.

# Endpoints

I am going to *strongly* recommend using [HTTPie](https://httpie.org) for
testing the endpoints in the command-line. Managing cookies and JSON encoding
with cURL is a pain, and HTTPie manages it well. All endpoint examples will be
done with HTTPie. The executable for HTTPie is `http`.

| Endpoint                        | Method | Auth       | Returns     | Description                                         |

## Login

### Logging In

Sets up a session with appropriate priviledges for subsequent requests.
Sessions are referenced by a cookie, so the cookie will need to be stored and
used in following requests.

There is a special `admin` user that has the username `"admin"` with a
shared-secret password. The admin user has priviledges for endpoints a regular
user does not have.

* URL

  `/login`

* Methods

  `POST`

* Payload

  `{ "user": "$USER_NAME", "password": "$PASSWORD" }`

* Authorization

  None, as this provides the means to get authorization

* Success Response:

  * `200`

* Error Response:

  * `401 Unauthorized`

  `{ "error" : "failed login attempt" }`

  * `500`

  Big catch-all for now. Something went wrong. Check the logs.

* Example request

  ```
  http POST :5000/login --session admin_session <<EOF
  { "user" : "admin", "password": "hunter2" }
  EOF

### Setting user datacenter access

Set the access permissions for a set of users for a set a datacenter rooms.

**NOTE:** Without BHDA access, I decided to use AZs as identifiers for the
datacenter rooms. We need a unique value that can identify a datacenter room.
We could also use the vendor name, but that's null-able. AZs are not unique, so
we could have multiple datacenter rooms with the same AZ (is this desired?).

* URL

  `/datacenter_access`

* Methods

  `PUT`

  This is an idempotent operation, so it is a **PUT** request rather than POST.

* Payload

  The payload is a JSON object with user names as keys, an a list of AZ names as values.

  ```
  { "${INTEGRATOR_NAME}" : ["${DATACENTER_ROOM_AZ}", ... ]}
  ...
  }
  ```

  **NOTE:** You can remote all user access by associating a list with
  non-existing datacenter names. e.g., `{ "no_access_user" : ["__NO_ACCESS__"] }`.
  Ideally, you could set this with a empty list, but because of how Perl
  handles hashes, this is a bug for now.

* Authorization

  Requires logged-in admin

* Success Response:

  * `200 Created`

  No payload in response.


* Error Response:

  * `401 Unauthorized`

  Unauthorized. Log in as admin first

  * `500`

  Big catch-all for now. Something went wrong. Check the logs.

* Example request

  ```
  http PUT :5000/datacenter_access --session admin_session <<EOF
  { "integrator_1234" : ["ap-southeast-1a"] }
  EOF
  ```

## Problems

### Listing all problems for integrator devices

Get a JSON object that describes all problems in the last Device Validation
Report for devices assigned to an integrator account.

Device Reports and their associated Validation Criteria are not heavily
normalized, so a long of munging is probably going to be required. As some
point, all tests associated with a device should have definitions in the
`device_validation_criteria` table, with associated log messages and
remediation steps. Big TODO here.

We try to return as much useful context for a given problem as possible, including:

* Device location
* Datacenter information
* Rack information
* Array of problems
* Validation criteria for each problem (if it exists)

* URL

  `/problem`

* Methods

  `GET`

* Authorization

  Requires integrator account.

* Success Response:

  * `200`
