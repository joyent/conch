=head1 NAME

Conch::Plugin::Database

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets up the database and provides convenient accessors to it.

=head1 HELPERS

=cut

sub register ($self, $app, $config) {

    # hashref containing dsn, username, password, options, ro_username, ro_password
    my $db_credentials = Conch::DB::Util::get_credentials($config->{database}, $app->log);


=head2 schema

Provides read/write access to the database via L<DBIx::Class>.  Returns a L<Conch::DB> object
that persists for the lifetime of the application.

=cut

    my $_rw_schema;
    $app->helper(schema => sub {
        return $_rw_schema if $_rw_schema;
        $_rw_schema = Conch::DB->connect(
            $db_credentials->@{qw(dsn username password options)},
        );
    });

=head2 rw_schema

See L</schema>; can be used interchangeably with it.

=cut

    $app->helper(rw_schema => $app->renderer->get_helper('schema'));

=head2 ro_schema

Provides (guaranteed) read-only access to the database via L<DBIx::Class>.  Returns a
L<Conch::DB> object that persists for the lifetime of the application.

Note that because of the use of C<< AutoCommit => 0 >>, database errors must be explicitly
cleared with C<< ->txn_rollback >>; see L<DBD::Pg/"ReadOnly-(boolean)">.

=cut

    my $_ro_schema;
    $app->helper(ro_schema => sub {
        if ($_ro_schema) {
            # clear the transaction of any errors, which accumulate because we have
            # AutoCommit => 0 for this connection.  Otherwise, we will get:
            # "current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block"
            # (as an alternative, we can turn the ReadOnly and AutoCommit flags off, and use
            # the read-only credentials to connect to the server.. but it is better to have
            # this safety here.)
            $_ro_schema->txn_rollback if $_ro_schema->storage->connected;
            return $_ro_schema;
        }

        # see L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI/DBIx::Class and AutoCommit>
        local $ENV{DBIC_UNSAFE_AUTOCOMMIT_OK} = 1;
        $_ro_schema = Conch::DB->connect(
            $db_credentials->@{qw(dsn ro_username ro_password)},
            +{
                $db_credentials->{options}->%*,
                ReadOnly    => 1,
                AutoCommit  => 0,
            },
        );
    });

=head2 db_<table>s, db_ro_<table>s

Provides direct read/write and read-only accessors to resultsets.  The table name is used in
the C<alias> attribute (see L<DBIx::Class::ResultSet/alias>).

=cut

    # db_user_accounts => $app->schema->resultset('user_account'), etc
    # db_ro_user_accounts => $app->ro_schema->resultset('user_account'), etc
    foreach my $source_name ($app->schema->sources) {
        my $plural = noun($source_name)->plural;

        $app->helper('db_'.$plural, sub ($c) {
            my $source = $c->schema->source($source_name);
            # note that $source_name eq $source->from unless we screwed up.
            $source->resultset->search(undef, { alias => $source->from });
        });

        $app->helper('db_ro_'.$plural, sub ($c) {
            my $ro_source = $c->ro_schema->source($source_name);
            $ro_source->resultset->search(undef, { alias => $ro_source->from });
        });
    }

=head2 txn_wrapper

    my $result = $c->txn_wrapper(sub ($c) {
        # many update, delete queries etc...
    });

    # if the result code was already set, we errored and rolled back the db...
    return if $c->res->code;

Wraps the provided subref in a database transaction, rolling back in case of an exception.
Any provided arguments are passed to the sub, along with the invocant controller.

If the exception is not C<'rollback'> (which signals an intentional premature bailout), the
exception will be logged, and a response will be set up as an error response with the first
line of the exception.

=cut

    $app->helper(txn_wrapper => sub ($c, $subref, @args) {
        try {
            # we don't do anything else here, so as to preserve context and the return value
            # for the original caller.
            $c->schema->txn_do($subref, $c, @args);
        }
        catch {
            my $exception = $_;

                $c->status($c->res->code // 400, { error => $error });
            }
            return;
        };
    });

    # are not aware of any issues on PostgreSQL 10.x.
